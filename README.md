# NLP-Basics

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

# STOP WORDS 

Stop Words are the irrelevant words that support a sentence. These basically include 'the','a','and' etc. These have least importance in NLP so they are removed while preprocessing of data for further use.

# WORDNET

Wordnet is a lexical database/dictionary of words for over 200 languages. WordNet links words into semantic relations including synonyms, hyponyms, antonyms and meronyms. The synonyms are grouped into synsets with short definitions and usage examples. WordNet can thus be seen as a combination and extension of a dictionary and thesaurus.
